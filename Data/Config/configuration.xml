                       <Description>
Have you ever wanted to play Resident Evil in first person? Well now you can!
STORY: Experience the 1998 Spencer Mansion Incident as Jill Valentine. Collect keys, solve puzzles, manage your limited resources and escape from the Survival Horror.

******KNOWN BUGS******
1) Clicking 'Equip' on an item in your main inventory - You will get an infinite wall of red text, to stop it, move an item from your toolbelt or into your toolbelt.
DO NOT ALT+F4 AS YOUR CHARACTER WILL RESET!
2) (The Linked Vault Storage is disabled by default due to bugs) In Multiplayer, when accessing an Untouched Vault,
*ALL* players need to open the Untouched Vault *BEFORE* anyone adds or removes items. Otherwise, ITEMS WILL DISAPPEAR!!!
3) (The Linked Vault Storage is disabled by default due to bugs) Unconfirmed on what the cause is, it may be due to trying to load into the game while you're not logged into steam, or playing a different save, vanilla or another mod.
The entire contents of 'The Vault' can get deleted. My advice is to commit to a playthrough before playing other 7 Days to Die playthroughs elsewhere.

Setup:
1) I've made setup easy to follow by making the text orange for all settings you'll need to manually change for the intended Resident Evil experience.
2) It will always be night, so be sure to change the Zombie Night Speed to your liking. (Walk is recommended)
3) If your game is in day time, you'll die a horrible death!

PLEASE NOTE: 
1) The Spencer Mansion Incident is a *PERMADEATH* mod, and will test your combat and maneuverability skills.
2) Multiplayer is now supported!!! So go have fun with a friend!
3) Twitch Integration is now supported!! I recommend to use only after completing the challenge before turning on.
KEY FEATURES:
1) Limited Inventory: You'll be restricted to a 6 slot toolbelt and 6 slots of main inventory.
2) Reworked and rebalanced Skill Tree: There are no attribute requirements for skills, so you'll be free to put your skill points wherever you wish as long as you have enough points.
3) You cannot jump.
4) Zombie Pain: Zombies no longer feel pain, so they won't even flinch when attacked.
5) Zombie Rage: Disabled, zombies will never enter rage mode and get faster.
6) One Time Looting: Almost every loot container can only be looted once, and will downgrade or destroy after closing.
7) Linked Storage (disabled by default due to bugs): You'll be able to access your stored items from any of the storage boxes. (Huge thank you to wOOkie nOOkie!!)
8) Simplified Criticals: I've removed the severe critical injuries (Broken arm/leg etc) and shortened the duration of fatigue. You can still get lessor criticals, like sprains, fatigue, stun and abrasions. (Falling too far will still break your leg!)
PLANNED FEATURE:
Manual Saving: Auto saving will be disabled and you'll need to use an Ink Ribbon to save your progress.
You'll have to manually save BEFORE you exit your game session.
Ink Ribbons will be very limited, and will allow you to continue your save if you die, by simply exiting the game and reloading your save to revert back to your last manual save.

UPDATES:
v2.0 changes (Requires Fresh Start)

Changed: You now start with 12 perk points, instead of 2, in the form of Training Manuals.
	 Choose your points wisely, as there are no refunds and no extras for the entire playthrough.
Changed: Perks are rebalanced, and each level now costs 1 Training Manual. Before, some perks cost 2 points.
Changed: All attributes are only 1 level, granting 250% headshot damage and 15% bonus to dismember.
Changed: You now start with 120 Health and Stamina instead of 100.
Changed: Power Attacks no longer pause stamina regeneration.
Removed: Demolitions Expert perk.
Added: Armour Tolerance perk. This perk does what Pain Tolerance used to do, but now also reduces the stamina and mobility penalties of armour.
Changed: Pain Tolerance now works like in vanilla, but slightly more potent. (TFP fixed a bug recently so this perk works as intended now)
Removed: Gloves, there are now 4 pieces of armour instead of 5.
Changed: Rebalanced the armour rating of all armour to compensate the loss of the gloves piece.
Changed: Rebalanced ammo crafting with the Reloading Tool, the amount of gunpowder to craft each round is equivilant to the firepower of that round.
Changed: Reloading Tool now stacks to 10 instead of 1, so ammo crafting is less tedious than before.
Added: Reloading Tool can now also allow you to dismantle standard ammo, at a cost of 25% gunpowder. (Requires Reloading Tool on you to dismantle)
Changed: Moved one of the Locked Reinforced chests to an earlier section of the mod for earlier access.
Changed: Removed campfire recipe and added campfires in most locations with a Storage Box. Includes the kitchen.
Added: Placed a Blue Herb in each of the mansion's Save Rooms.
Changed: Poison is now more deadly, lowering health every 30 seconds instead of 50.
Removed: You no longer get XP from harvesting anything, or reading books. XP is mostly earned from kills.
Changed: Player Level and Gamestage is solely used for Twitch Integration and mod progression, no perk points.
Changed: Herbs heal more, up to 60 with a mixture of G+R+B. This mixture used to heal 40.
Changed: Medical healing recovers health at 5 per tick instead of 2.
Changed: Nerfed the firepower of the AK-47 from 42 Standard and 56 HiPower, to 24 Standard and 30 HiPower.
Added: Another 60 rounds of Assault Rifle ammo, bringing the total non-crafted amount from 90 to 150.
Changed: Extra 2 Player support, some looted items now come in doubles.
Fixed: Rockets now cause radius damage instead of just impact damage. Displayed value applies to both, so direct hits are double the displayed value.
Changed: Difficulty rebalanced, higher difficulties now increase Enemy HP instead of reducing the players damage inflicted to enemies.
