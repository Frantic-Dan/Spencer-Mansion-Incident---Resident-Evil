** Requires A20.2 (b2) **


Have you ever wanted to play Resident Evil in first person? Well now you can!

STORY: Experience the 1998 Spencer Mansion Incident as Jill Valentine. Collect keys, solve puzzles, manage your limited resources and escape from the Survival Horror.


		******KNOWN BUGS******

1) Clicking 'Equip' on an item in your main inventory - You will get an infinite wall of red text, to stop it, move an item from your toolbelt or into your toolbelt.
DO NOT ALT+F4 AS YOUR CHARACTER WILL RESET!

2) In Multiplayer, when accessing an Untouched Vault, *ALL* players need to open the Untouched Vault *BEFORE* anyone adds or removes items.
Otherwise, ITEMS WILL DISAPPEAR!!!



Setup:
1) Requires A20.2 (b2)
2) When starting a new game, make sure to select the 'Spencer Mansion Incident' world.
3) I've made setup easy to follow by making the text orange for all settings you'll need to manually change for the intended Resident Evil experience.
4) It will always be night, so be sure to change the Zombie Night Speed to your liking. (Walk is recommended)

(If your game is in day time, you'll die a horrible death!)


**IMPORTANT**
PLEASE NOTE: 
1) The Spencer Mansion Incident is a Permadeath mod, and will test your combat and maneuverability skills.
2) Multiplayer is now supported!!! So go have fun with a friend!
3) If you don't change the orange coloured game settings to their stated value, you'll be playing with unintended settings.
4) Currently, Twitch Integration is not supported, but is planned.

			
KEY FEATURES:
1) Limited Inventory: You'll be restricted to a 6 slot toolbelt and 6 slots of main inventory.
2) Reworked and rebalanced Skill Tree: There are no attribute requirements for skills,
so you'll be free to put your skill points wherever you wish as long as you have enough points.
3) You cannot jump.
4) Zombie Pain: Zombies no longer feel pain, so they won't even flinch when attacked.
5) Zombie Rage: Disabled, zombies will never enter rage mode and get faster.
6) One Time Looting: Almost every loot container can only be looted once, and will downgrade or destroy after closing.
7) Linked Storage: You'll be able to access your stored items from any of the storage boxes. (Huge thank you to wOOkie nOOkie!!)
8) Simplified Criticals: I've removed the severe critical injuries (Broken arm/leg etc) and shortened the duration of fatigue.
You can still get lessor criticals, like sprains.

PLANNED FEATURE:
Manual Saving: Auto saving will be disabled and you'll need to use an Ink Ribbon to save your progress.
You'll have to manually save BEFORE you exit your game session.
Ink Ribbons will be very limited, and will allow you to continue your save if you die, by simply exiting the game and reloading your save to revert back to your last manual save.
