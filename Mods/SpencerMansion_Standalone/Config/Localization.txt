Sorry Alma.\n\nI sit here trying to think of where to begin, of how to explain in a few simple words all that's happened in my life since we last spoke, and already I fail. I hope this letter finds you well, and that you'll forgive the tangents of my pen; this isn't easy for me.\n\nEven as I write, I can feel the simplest of concepts slipping away, lost to feelings of despair and confusion -- but I have to tell you what's in my heart before I can rest. Alma, please believe that what I'm telling you is the truth. The entire story would take hours for me to tell you, and time is short, so accept these things as fact: last month there was an accident in the lab and the virus we were studying leaked.\n\nAll my colleagues who were infected are dead or dying, and the nature of the disease is such that those still living have lost their senses. This virus robs its victims of their humanity, forcing them in their sickness to seek out and destroy life. Even as I write these words, I can hear them, pressing against my door like mindless, hungry animals.\n\nAlma, I have tried to survive only to see you again. But my efforts only delayed the inevitable; I am infected, and there is no cure for what will follow - except to end my life before I lose the only thing that separates me from them.\n\nMy love for you.\n\nIn an hour I'll have entered my eternal sleep where there is peace. Please understand. Please know that I'm sorry.\nMartin Crackhorn"

A guy in a lab coat came with a plate of skimpy meal and said to me, 'Sorry to put you through this but it's for security reasons.' That's when it hit me. It all makes sense now. There are only two people that know the secret of this mansion, Sir Spencer and myself. If they kill me, Sir Spencer will be the only person that knows the secret. But for what purpose? It doesn't matter now. It's too dangerous here. My family... I hope they are all right. I've decided to escape... Jessica, Lisa, I pray you are safe.\n\nNov. 26, 1967\nHow could I be so careless? I lost my favorite lighter - the one Jessica gave me for my birthday. Now it's going to be that much harder to get out this dark place.\nNov. 13th, the date when my fate was sealed. My aunt was hospitalized just three days before that. Jessica and Lisa said that they were going to visit her. I wish I could be there with them. But wait, even as I'm writing my memory is coming back to me more vividly. Just before I passed out, I remember the men in the lab coats said something like, 'Most likely your family is already...' I pray for their safety.\n\nNov. 27, 1967\nSomehow I managed to get out that room. But getting out of this mansion won't be as easy. I have to get past all the booby-traps. Tiger Eyes, Gold Emblem... I have to try and remember for my own sake...."

The laboratory with the large glass tubes filled with formaldehyde and those dark, wet and eerie caves... What can I do?\nAt first I didn't want to believe my eyes. But that familiar high-heeled shoe in the corridor... It was like reflex. One name came to my mind, Jessica!\nI don't want to believe they share the same fate as me. No! I can't give up hope. I have to hope they're alive.\n\nNov. 30, 1967\nI haven't had anything to eat or drink for the past few days. I feel like I'm going crazy. Why is this happening to me? Why do I have to die like this? I was too obsessed with designing this ghastly mansion. I should have known better.\n\nNov. 31, 1967\nIt was a dark and damp underground tunnel. And another dead end. But even in the darkness something caught my eye. Carefully, I lit the last match, I had to see what it was. A grave! But deeply engraved into the stone was my name! 'George Trevor'. At that instant, it all became clear to me. Those bastards knew from the beginning that I'd die here and I fell right into their trap. But it's too late now. I'm losing it. Everything is becoming so far away. Jessica... Lisa... Forgive me. Because of my ego, I got both of you involved in this whole damn conspiracy. Forgive me.

BotanyBookTip,"Uses of Medicinal Herbs\n\nIt is a well-known fact that there exist many plants that are credited with medicinal healing powers. Since ancient times, mankind has been healing wounds and diseases using various plants.\n\nIn this book, we will sample three herbs that are native of the Arklay Mountains and briefly outline each of their medicinal qualities. Each herb has a distinct color and a distinct medicinal quality.\n\nThe green herb recovers physical strength. The blue herb neutralizes natural toxins. However, the red herb has no real effect by itself. We have found that mixing green and red herbs results in a magnified effect.\n\nWe will outline the effects of red herbs when mixed with other herbs when we have more data. Meanwhile feel free to experiment on your own, for true knowledge is best acquired through own experience."

ResearcherLetterTip,"June 8th 1998\nMy dearest Ada.\n\nBy the time you read this letter, I will no longer be the person you once knew. The results of my test came out today, and as I suspected, it came out positive.\n\nI feel like I am teetering on the edge of reason just thinking about my impending doom. I would give anything not to have to become one of them.\n\nAs far as I know, you are not infected. I sincerely hope things do not reach such a desperate pass, but if it has turned out that you are now the last person remaining alive, I want you to get the material from the Visual Data Room.\n\nThen, activate the Self-Destruct System in the Power Room, and escape from here. Please do everything in your power to make this whole accident public.\n\nIf everything is still running normally, you should be able to release all the locks using the Security System.\n\nI have set up the terminal in the small security room so that you can log in to the system using my name and your name as the password.\n\nYou will need another password to release the lock of the door in Basement Level Two where the Visual Data Room is located.\n\nAs a safety measure I have coded that password into an X-ray picture; a roentgenogram. I know you, and I'm sure you will be able to work it out without any trouble.\n\nThere is just one more thing... and it is my last request. I hope you never have to lay eyes on me in this state, but if you do happen to run into me in my hideous form, I beg you to put me out of my misery. I hope you understand.\n\nThank you, Ada.\nYours truly,\nJohn"

ObservationNoteTip,"The discovery of the G-Virus was in fact 21 years after the administration of the progenitor virus.\n\nThe 'Prototype Parasite' which we had delivered from a laboratory in France was administered to the sample specimen. The sample specimen took in the parasite without showing any signs of adverse reaction.\n\nThe lack of any reaction was an unsolved mystery. But now everything is clear to me now.\n\nThe 'Prototype Parasite' was incubating in the sample specimen's body for 21 years. Then from that incubating state the prototype suddenly mutated. ('Evolved' may be a more appropriate word to describe it.)\n\nThis observation gave me more insight in my research. Through further modification and testing, I was able to derive a method to create the 'G' that surpasses the performance of the 'T'.\n\nThis was the breakthrough that would change the future of the B.O.W.'s history.\n\nI can't wait to see the look on Alexia's annoying face when I finally announce my research. But unfortunately I'll have to wait a few more years to completely verify my findings.\n\nWilliam Birkin"

Those damn things are pure evil.\n\nThere was no other way. He would have done the same if it were the other way around. After I put him out of his misery I had to just put him in the bathroom. Now I'm probably the last one...\n\nHow could this happen? I'll never forgive myself for being part of this project. Eventually I'll get what's coming to me, though. There's no way to escape from this nut house, it's just a matter of time now.\n\nEverything is set. All I need is a little courage to get it done. Knowing that I'll leave many things undone is regret beyond words.\n\nBut, this is better than just waiting to turn into one of them.

Plant 42 Report,Plant 42 Report
Plant42ReportTip_title,Plant 42 Report
Plant42ReportTip,"Four days have passed since the accident. The plant at Point 42 is growing at an amazing rate.\n\nAlthough there are many unknown aspects about this plant, we know that in comparison with the other group of plants, the T-Virus has had a substantially stronger affect on this one.\n\nThe T-Virus has drastically morphed its host's anatomy as well as its size. Looking at its current state, it's difficult to imagine its original appearance. Nowhere on Earth will you find anything like it.\n\nWe've also found that PLANT 42 has two main sources of acquiring its necessary nutrients. One source is through its root. Somehow it has rooted itself down into the basement.\n\nImmediately after the accident, a scientist went mad and destroyed the Aqua Ring. Ever since, the basement has been like a pool. There is a high possibility that it's one of the chemicals in the water that's promoting the PLANT 42's rapid growth.\n\nHowever, we have yet to determine the specific chemical.\n\nA bulb-like body of the PLANT 42 has been sighted hanging from the ceiling of the first floor. We are sure that it used the air ducts to reach the first floor. Numerous long tentacle-like vines are protruding from the bulb.\n\nWe believe the vines are the second means of acquiring its nutrients. When the PLANT 42 senses prey, it uses the tentacle-like vines to capture its prey. After doing so, suckers on the vine drain the prey of its blood.\n\nWe've also noticed that it has some intelligence. When it captures its prey or when it's inactive, the vines twine around the door to stop possible intruders.\n\nUnfortunately, several of our scientists have already fallen victim to this PLANT 42. When we heard the stories from the survivors, they all observed one thing in common:\n\nWhen the uniform petal-like flaps open and reveal its vital internals, it has a tendency to become more aggressive.\n\nOne witness reported that it was as if it was trying to protect itself. Why it behaves the way it does is still unknown.\n\nMay 21, 1998\nHenry Sarton"

OrganicChemistryLabExperimentTip,"The similarities in the cellular characteristics of the rapidly growing plant infected by the Tyrant Virus have been reported in previous papers. However, while repeating these experiments, an interesting new fact became clear.\n\nWe learned that a chemical in the UMB family, UMB No. 20, contains a compound that is toxic to the cells of the plant.\n\nWe have given UMB No. 20 a new name: V-JOLT. If calculations prove correct, when V-JOLT is applied directly to the root of the plant, the entire plant should be dead within 5 seconds.\n\nThe V-JOLT can be made by simply mixing the VP and UMB chemicals in a specific ratio. However, extra care must be taken when handling these UMB chemicals. They have been known to generate toxic gases if mishandled.\n\nThe characteristics of each UMB chemical are as follows:\n\nUMB No. 3   red\nYellow-6   yellow\nUMB No. 7   green\nUMB No. 10   orange\nVP-017   blue\nV-JOLT   dark brown"

Today they gave me another shot saying it was 'nutrition'.\n\nWhen they give me the shots mommy can think straight, but mommy's shocked and sad because mommy's unable to think of you all the time.\n\nMommy's afraid. Afraid of forgetting everything, especially the memories of you and daddy... What your faces look like, how we used to be together... They're all starting to disappear into somewhere dark in my mind.\n\nOh Lisa, I wish I could touch your face and hold you in my arms right now, so that I can hold on to our wonderful memories of you and daddy.\n\nLisa we can't stay here any longer. We have to escape!\n\nListen to me Lisa. Our chance to escape is the next time we go to that lab together. We'll both pretend that we are both unconscious and when that man in white clothes is off guard that will be our chance.\n\nWhen we're on the outside, let's look for daddy together. Okay sweetie?

VACTTip_title,V-ACT
VACTTip,"Researcher's note\n\nThere is now evidence that when the host loses consciousness, the body goes into a dormant state. During this time the virus becomes active and rapidly transforms and reconstructs the basic composition of the body.\n\nThe host eventually mutated into a humanoid creature. (We call them V-ACTs)\n\nIts speed and amazing muscular development are particularly noteworthy. After transformation, it becomes more agile and aggressive.\n\nAlready four of our researchers have died from trying to feed it, turning the place into an instant blood bath. (Ever since this tragic and barbaric accident, we have decided to call its kind 'Crimson Heads')\n\nThat dangerous and precious prototype specimen can't be left there. We have to figure out a way to deal with it. Termination is definitely not an option.\n\nWe finally decided to freeze the specimen and confine the body inside the basement of the backyard cemetery."

Any copying, or disclosure of the contents of this fax to any third party is strictly forbidden by the sender.\n\nAfter reading the contents of this fax, it must be destroyed immediately.\n\nWe expect significant increase in the damage done by the recent T-Virus' outbreak than initially estimated. There are several concerns.\n\nFirst concern\nMore than half of the researchers have been infected by the T-Virus and died. It has also been reported that almost all of the survivors of this accident are starting to show symptoms of the T-Virus infection.\n\nSecond concern\nOur Secret Security Patrol Team has also been completely eradicated. Therefore, our most secret research is in danger of public disclosure. Quick actions are demanded to prevent mass media coverage.\n\nThird concern\nThere is a high possibility that most of the specimens are running loose inside the compound. We expect many casualties to follow.\n\nHowever yet unfortunate, these casualties underscore the success of our research results. Actions must be taken to prevent our research results from being made public.\n\nWe suspect the first official intervention will come from the State Police and S.T.A.R.S.
